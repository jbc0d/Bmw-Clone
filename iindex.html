<h2>THE BME M1 (E26) </h2>
<p>With its timeless wedge shape, the first vehicle developed by the then BMW Motorsport GmbH in the late seventies gets an
 enthusiastic welcome. Developed by design legend Giorgio Giugiaro, the shape is based on the BMW Turbo, a 1972 study by BMWs
  longtime designer Paul Bracq. The narrow kidneys, the folding headlights and the clearly-drawn lines combine esthetics and
   dynamics. And the performance is also legendary: Until 1983 it is the fastest production vehicle in Germany. The mid-engine
    super sports car reaches a maximum speed of well over 260 km/h, establishing the tradition of M road vehicles.</p>
    
    <p>From 1979 to 1981 only 460 vehicles are made  all hand built. Anyone lucky enough to drive an BMW M1 talks of its 
        exceptional driving style, flexible curve dynamics and fast-turning 3.5 liter engine.
    </p> <p>Production period: 1978 to1981

        Engines: 3.5 liters (204 kW, 277 hp), 6-cylinder
        
        Length/width/height: 4,359 mm / 1,824 mm / 1,138 mm</p>

        Even though the BMW 1 has been delighting drivers who appreciate sportiness and outstanding handling in a compact vehicle
         since 2004, the BMW 1 M Coupé has only been available since 2011. A twin turbocharger boosts the inline 6-cylinder petrol 
        engine to 340 hp (250 kW). Combined with the short wheelbase and the wider track than the regular BMW 1, this provides a 
         driving experience with extraordinary dynamics. More than 6,300 vehicles were built up to 2012. Three years later the BMW 
         M2 joins the series, continuing the concept of merging a compact vehicle with the best characteristics of a sports car.

        <h2>BMW M2 (F87,G87)</h2>
        <p>Since 2015 the BMW M2 has been the successor to the BMW 1 M Coupé, and has continued the dynamic, powerful compact
             series established by the BMW 2002 Turbo and the BMW M3 (E30).
       
        The vehicles distinctive, confident exterior with its wide-flared wings and large inlets in the front apron are a 
        testament to this. The 6-cylinder, turbo petrol engine has impressive torque and power, transferred to the road via
        an optional double-clutch transmission. The BMW M2 Competition, with an additional output of 30 kW (40 hp), took over
        in 2018 and is surpassed only by the BMW M2 CS (Club Sport). This has a production run of just 2,200 vehicles and an
         engine producing 331 kW (450 hp). In every version, the M chassis ensures clean, clear handling, precise control,
        and driving pleasure.
            
       The second generation of the BMW M2 will appear in 2022, the 50th anniversary year of BMW M GmbH - and with its
        unmistakable M character it shows itself to be a homage to pure motorsport feeling. With a new expressive exterior
         in classic box design, compact proportions and an assertive stance, it promises pure driving pleasure with maximum
        handling control. Perfectly tuned chassis components from BMW M and a powerful BMW M TwinPower Turbo 6-cylinder petrol
        engine enable acceleration from 0-100 km/h from 4.1 seconds and a top speed of 250 km/h thanks to impressive power
           igures of 338 kW (460 hp). 
            
        Production period BMW M2: 2015 to today, M2 Competition: 2018 to 2020, M2 CS: 2020

        <h2>BMW M3</h2>
        <p>Originally, the BMW M3 (E30/2S, E30/2SC) is intended to be the road version of a racing saloon. However, interest is
             so overwhelming that many more than the 5,000 vehicles needed for Group A approval are sold. Extreme dynamics are
              immediately evident on the exterior; from the wide fenders and iconic rear wings to the newly designed C-pillar.
               The interior also features everything that has proven its worth in racing: internally ventilated brake discs, 
               sports transmission with lower left first gear, the 2.3 liter 4-cylinder petrol engine with 200 hp (143 kW).
<br><br>
        While the racing version goes from win to win, the BMW M3 exceeds all sales expectations: More than 18,000 vehicles,
         including the convertible version, are sold. As well as the revised 220 hp (154 kW) Evolution version and the BMW M3 
         Sport Evolution with 2.5 liter displacement and 238 hp (166 kW).
         <br><br>
        1992 sees the second generation of the BMW M3 (E36) continuing the success story. The vehicle is clearly more grown-up.
         There are only minor visual changes compared to the regular model, such the aerodynamically optimized M exterior mirrors.
          But there are radical changes under the hood: The inline 6-cylinder petrol engine with 286 hp (210 kW) and variable
           overhead camshafts (VANOS system) delivers breathtaking acceleration. From 1995 the model is updated to give not just
            200 cm3 more displacement, but also 321 hp (236 kW).
            <br><br>
         At the turn of the millennium, the third version of the BMW M3 (E46) is launched, followed by the BMW M3 Convertible one
          year later. They continue the fundamental concept behind the BMW M3, combining as little weight as possible with as much
           power as possible. The M genes are evident in the 343 hp (252 kW) driving experience. The exteriors of the Coupé and 
           Convertible differ from the standard model with their wider camber, the grilles on the front fenders and the powerdome
            on the hood.
            <br><br>
         The BMW M3s built between 2007 and 2013 are now fitted with a number of new features. Just like the regular models,
          three bodies are available: Sedan (E90), Coupé (E92), and Convertible (E93). For the first time, a BMW M3 has a V8
           engine. The 4-liter assembly delivers 420 hp (309 kW) and turns up to 8,300 rpm to the highest-speed production engine
            ever built by BMW! With the optional M Drivers Package, the car reaches a maximum speed of 280 km/h.
            <br><br>
         From 2014, the fifth generation of the BMW M3 (F80) once again relies on an inline 6-cylinder petrol engine which, for
          the first time in an BMW M3, is fitted with turbochargers. The engine delivers its maximum torque at 1,850 rpm, making
           fast acceleration possible, whatever the circumstances. The 432 hp (317 kW) BMW M3 Sedan is the only body design 
           available to the related Coupé and Convertible are now called BMW M4. The fender extensions, the M exterior mirrors,
            and the dark M carbon roof also show to the outside world that this vehicle has exceptional handling and driving
             dynamics. 2016 sees the introduction of the BMW M3 Competition, featuring an engine that delivers 450 hp (331 kW)
              and uses the adaptive M chassis as standard.
              <br><br>
         In 2018, the BMW M3 CS is manufactured for just three months, with an engine adding an additional 10 hp to bring it to
          460 hp (338 kW).
          <br><br>
         The BMW M3 (G80) has been available since 2021 with a radically different appearance from the standard sedan due to its large,
          high-standing kidney. It continues the concept of combining sportiness, dynamism, and everyday practicality of the previous
         BMW M3 to the Sports Sedan is equipped with a manual 6-speed transmission and 480 hp (353 kW) engine. The BMW M3
          Competition is also available, offering 510 hp (375 kW). The Drivelogic 8-speed M Steptronic transmission enables
           rapid gear changes for maximum driving dynamics, combined with the precisely-tuned M chassis.
           <br><br>
        Production period BMW M3: 1986 to today
        <br><br>
         Engines: 2.3 to 3.0 liters (143 to 375 kW, 200 to 510 hp), 4-, 6- & 8-cylinder

<h2>THE BMW M4 (F82, F83, G82).</h2>
<p>The BMW 4 series replaces the 3 Series Coupé and represents a clear break. Obviously designed from scratch, this vehicle
     differs significantly from the BMW 3 series with its recessed passenger compartment, longer hood and shorter overhangs to
     all leading to a more expressive, more powerful appearance. This also applies to the BMW M4 Coupé and the M4 Coupé 
     Competition (2016 to 2020) delivering 450 hp (331 kW), as well as the 2017 and 2018 M4 Coupé CS with 460 hp (338 kW).
      Meanwhile, the M4 is available as GTS Coupé (2017 to 2018), powered by 500 hp (368 kW). The M4 Convertible and the M4 
      Convertible Competition bring a breath of fresh air. All vehicles use a 3.0 liter 6-cylinder petrol engine with a twin
       scroll turbocharger.
<br><br>
    The considerably longer and wider second generation sets clear visual accents with the double kidney standing high and
     tilted forward. With the BMW M4, the 3.0 liter petrol engine with 6 cylinders delivers 480 hp (manual transmission) and 
     510 hp (8-speed automatic transmission) (353 and 375 kW respectively). With the optional M Drivers Package, it reaches a 
     speed of 290 km/h. Dynamism and liveliness are underscored by precise, uncompromising design.
